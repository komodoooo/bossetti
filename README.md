<br>A golang utility for Windows that helps you check if a file is guilty through Virus Total API.<br>
Better than any antivirus because it's not bloated.

### Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/komodoooo/bossetti
cd bossetti/src
make      # make sure to edit bossetti.go file with your apikey inside the constant
make setup
make clean
```
### Usage
Everytime you will turn on your PC and do something, Bossetti will monitor your download directory, scanning new downloaded files with virustotal and notifing you the details, protecting you from possible threats.

Also, you can start a scan manually via the contextual menu "Scan with bossetti"

Why Bossetti is doing this? Because he was accused of false crimes... after realizing how corrupt the world around him is, he now wants the best for you!
